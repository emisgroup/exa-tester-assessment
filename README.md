# Automated Tester - Technical Assessment

Our tech teams are curious, driven, intelligent, pragmatic, collaborative and open-minded and you should be too.

## Testing Goals
We are testing your ability to design tests for a website, using existing tools (Cypress, Selenium, â€¦) to demonstrate how you would automate this test cases.

## Task
For this task use an existing mock website, we recommend looking at the one provided by Cypress
https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app
clone repository, checkout main branch
Then follow installation & run app instruction 
yarn install (this could take a several minutes)
yarn dev (this could take a several  minutes)

**Note:** On the login page you are able to create a test user

The task is to review the mock website. Document the test cases you would need to cover its functionality, then provide the code to run through these tests. Please provide instruction of how to run these tests automatically 

## Evaluation
We take into account 5 areas when evaluating a solution. Each criteria is evaluated from 0 (non-existent) to 5 (excellent) and your final score would be a simple average across all 5 areas. These are:

- Functionality: Is the solution correct? Does it run in a decent amount of time? How well thought and architected is the solution?
- Good Practices: Does the code follow standard practices for the language and framework used? Take into account reusability, names, function length, structure, how crendentials are handled, etc.
- Testing: Test design and coverage.
- Execution environment: Container, Virtual Environment, Dependency Management, Isolation, Ease of transition into a production environment etc.
- Documentation: How to install and run the solution? How to see and use the results? What is the architecture? Any next steps? 

## Submit your solution	
Create a public Github repository and push your solution including any documentation you feel necessary. Commit often - we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, please send us the URL to the repository.
